# PHM-AI_Agent-System
The PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) Agent System is a robust, distributed framework for real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance of propulsion systems. By leveraging a multi-agent architecture, the system enables early detection of potential failures, continuous improvement through machine learning.
