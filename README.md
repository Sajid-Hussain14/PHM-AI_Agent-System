**((Project Will be live Soon)) **


PHM Agent System is an intelligent, multi-agent framework designed for real-time prognostics and health management of engineering systems.
This project demonstrates a complete implementation of a distributed, agent-based architecture that integrates data collection, anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and automated learning in a cohesive system.
